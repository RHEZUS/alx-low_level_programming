# Tasks
Each of the lines in this table is a different program that performs the action explained in the description column.

| **Program** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| [`0-preprocessor`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/0-preprocessor) | A shell script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file. The C file name should be saved in the variable *$CFILE*. The output should be saved in the file c |
| [`1-compiler`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/1-compiler) | A shell script that compiles a C file but does not link The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file should be named the same as the C file but with the extension .o instead of .c. Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.o|
| [`2-assembler`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/2-assembler) | A shell script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file should be named the same as the C file but with the extension .s instead of .c. Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s |
| [`3-name`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/4-puts.c) | A shell script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE |
| [`4-puts.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c) | C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line. We are allowed to use **put** but not **printf** |
| [`5-printf.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/5-printf.c) | C program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line. Use the function *printf*. You are not allowed to use the function puts. The program should return 0. Your program should compile without warning when using the -Wall gcc option |
| [`6-size.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/6-size.c) | C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. You should produce the exact same output as in the example. Warnings are allowed. Your program should return 0. **You might have to install the package libc6-dev-i386 on your Linux to test the -m32 gcc option** |
| [`100-intel`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/100-intel) | A shell script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE. The output file should be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c. Example: if the C file is main.c, the output file should be main.s|
| [`101-quote.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x00-hello_world/101-quote.c) | C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error. You are not allowed to use any functions listed in the NAME section of the man (3) printf or man (3) puts. Your program should return 1. Your program should compile without any warnings when using the -Wall gcc option|
