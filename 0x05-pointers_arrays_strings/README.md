## Programs

| **Program** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------|
| [`0-reset_to_98.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c) | Write a function that takes a pointer to an `int` as a parameter and updates the value it points to to `98`. Prototype: `void reset_to_98(int *n);`. |
| [`1-swap.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c) | Write a function that swaps the values of two integers. Prototype: `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);` |
| [`2-strlen.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c) | Write a function that returns the length of a string. Prototype: `int _strlen(char *s);` |
| [`3-puts.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c) | Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout. Prototype: `void _puts(char *str);` |
| [`4-print_rev.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c) | Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line. Prototype: `void print_rev(char *s);` |
| [`5-rev_string.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c) | Write a function that reverses a string. Prototype: `void rev_string(char *s);` |
| [`6-puts2.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c) | Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line. Prototype: `void puts2(char *str);` |
| [`7-puts_half.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c) | Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. Prototype: `void puts_half(char *str);`. The function should print the second half of the string. If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last `n`. characters of the string, where `n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2`. |
| [`8-print_array.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c) | Write a function that prints `n` elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. Prototype: `void print_array(int *a, int n);`. where `n` is the number of elements of the array to be printed. Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space. The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array. You are allowed to use `printf`. |
| [`9-strcpy.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c) | Prototype: char `*_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);` Write a function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffer pointed to by `dest`. Return value: the pointer to `dest` |
| [`100-atoi.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/100-atoi.c) | Write a function that converts a string to an integer. Prototype: `int _atoi(char *s);`. The number in the string can be preceded by an infinite number of characters. You need to take into account all the `-` and `+` signs before the number. If there are no numbers in the string, the function must return `0`. You are not allowed to use `long`. You are not allowed to declare new variables of the “type” array. You are not allowed to hard-code special values. We will use the `-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow` gcc flag to compile your code. |
| [`101-keygen.c`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/101-keygen.c) | Create a program that generates random valid passwords for the program [101-crackme](https://github.com/alx-tools/0x04.c). You are allowed to use the standard library. You don’t have to pass the `betty-style` tests (you still need to pass the `betty-doc` tests). man `srand`, `rand`, `time`. `gdb` and `objdump` can help |
