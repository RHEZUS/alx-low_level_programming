## Projects

| **Project** | **Descroption** |
|--------------|----------------|
| [`0x00-hello_world`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world) | Learn the basics concepts of c programming and the first hello world program |
| [`0x01-variables_if_else_while`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while) | Practice with variables if else conditional structure and loops (while loop especially)|
| [`0x02-functions_nested_loops`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops) | Learn and practice how to use functions in c and work with nested loops|
| [`0x03-debugging`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x03-debugging) | As it is essential for a software engineer to be able to debug his code, this project aimed to practice debugging methods and debug codes|
| [`0x04-more_functions_nested_loops`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops) | This project aimed to go a step further with functions and loops in C programming|
| [`0x05-pointers_arrays_strings`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) | The project 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings aimed to practice what we learned about arrays, strings and pointer and combine them|
| [`0x06-pointers_arrays_strings`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings) | This project aimed to a step further with pointers, arrays and strings.|
| [`0x07-pointers_arrays_strings`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings) | This project aimed to a step further with pointers, arrays and strings. |
| [`0x08-recursion`](https://github.com/RHEZUS/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x08-recursion) | The aim of this project was to use recursive functions to solve various problems|
